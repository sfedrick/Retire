This is a my customized retirement app calculater. 

First run the following command 
<code>chmod +x activate_first_time.sh</code>

then run the code using <code>./run_app</code>

# Features
There are several features for this app. It includes basic things like compound interest from savings. Along with how much your salary has to keep up to keep up with interest. I recommend starting from when you first started saving. To see if you are on track with your retirement goals and if you can save less or more.

# Debt payoff 
I include an option to enter debts and the speed at which you pay them off. Once this debt is paid off the money used to pay off the debt is added to your savings.

# Promotions 
You can enter anticipated promotions in your career planning.

# Upcoming features
I will add an excel input to input onetime windfalls and large payments.

I will add a plots of income over time adjusted for inflation.
